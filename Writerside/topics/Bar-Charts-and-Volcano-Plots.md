# Bar Charts and Violin Plots

With each selected protein or PTM, Curtain will generate bar charts and violin plots for the sample data associated with the protein or PTM site.

By default, the bar charts and violin plots could be found as you scroll down the page along with the protein card in the `Raw Data Distribution` tab.

The bar charts and violin plots are generated using the sample data from the searched (original) data file with colors of the bar and violin assigned based on the sample condition.

To modify the bar charts and violin plots, you can click on at the toolbar `Plot` -> `Sample Order & Visibility Settings`.
