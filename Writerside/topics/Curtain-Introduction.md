# Introduction

Data sharing is an important aspect of scientific research. A major proportion of these would be done through exchanging 
information at conferences, presentations or publications. However, the shared data is often not interactive and requires 
some expertise to visually explore.
Curtain attempts to lower this barrier of entry by providing researchers with a place where their analytical result can 
be uploaded, shared and explored interactively. At of current, Curtain offers support for Total Proteomics and PTM 
Proteomics data. We hope to extend the coverage to other form of scientific data in the future.


## Overview

Curtain is both a data repository and an interactive resources of downstream differential analysis results.
Each exploratory session is independent of each other and is assigned a unique identification code after saving so that the session data could be shared with others.
Those viewing the session can make modifications to the session and when save will be also given a new unique code to avoid overwritten of the original session.

## Features

- Storage of differential analysis results and the data that was used for the differential analysis
- Highly customizable plots and color schemes
- Interactive volcano plot visualization of differential analysis results
- Correlation matrix
- Profile plot
- Data selection using built-in or provided list of protein of interests
- Selected data from volcano plot is linked with the original data and visualized in form of bar charts and violin plots
- Direct fetching of UniProt data for annotation of upload data with UniProt Accession IDs
- Embedded StringDB interaction plot
- Embedded InteractomeAtlas interaction plot
- ProteomicsDB expression data of the protein of interests
- AlphaFold predicted protein structure viewer
- Shareable unique link session
- Selected aggregated PTM data from the knowledgebase for proteins of interests
- Kinase Library for prediction of potential kinase
