# Introduction

Data sharing is an important aspect of scientific research. A major proportion of these would be done through exchanging 
information at conferences, presentations or publications. However, the shared data is often not interactive and requires 
some expertise to visually explore.
Curtain attempts to lower this barrier of entry by providing researchers with a place where their analytical result can 
be uploaded, shared and explored interactively. At of current, Curtain offers support for Total Proteomics and PTM 
Proteomics data. We hope to extend the coverage to other form of scientific data in the future.


## Overview

Curtain is both a data repository and an interactive resources of downstream differential analysis results.
Each exploratory session is independent of each other and is assigned a unique identification code after saving so that the session data could be shared with others.
Those viewing the session can make modifications to the session and when save will be also given a new unique code to avoid overwritten of the original session.
