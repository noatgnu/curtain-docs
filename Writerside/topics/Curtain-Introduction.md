# Curtain - Introduction

Data sharing is an important aspect of scientific research. A major proportion of these would be done through exchanging 
information at conferences, presentations or publications. However, the shared data is often not interactive and requires 
some expertise to visually explore.
Curtain attempts to lower this barrier of entry by providing researchers with a place where their analytical result can 
be uploaded, shared and explored interactively. At of current, Curtain offers support for Total Proteomics and PTM 
Proteomics data. We hope to extend the coverage to other form of scientific data in the future.
