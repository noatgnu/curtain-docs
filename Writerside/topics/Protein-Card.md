# Protein Card

Each selected protein will have a protein card section associated with it. This would generally contain data such as UniProt
subcelluar location, gene names, primary ids, uniprot accession ids, selection group, and the sample data associated with the protein.

## Total Proteomics

The protein card for total proteomics will allow you to add or remove the selected protein from volcano plot annotation or profile plot.
Within this card section, you can also view the bar charts and violin plots of the protein across all samples in the `Raw Data Distribution` tab and aggregated protein data from UniProt in `Protein Information` tab. This would includes functional description, functional domains, involvement in diseases, mutagenesis, and pharmacological usage.
Further expression data from the knowledgebase can be viewed in the `ProteomicsDB` tab. Potential interaction data can be found in the `StringDB` and `Interactome Atlas` tab.

## PTM Proteomics

The protein card for PTM proteomics will also allow you to add or remove the selected PTM from volcano plot annotation or profile plot (under `A` button action).
