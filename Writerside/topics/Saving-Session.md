# Saving Session

If you want to share or save your data and settings, you can do so by clicking `Session` -> `Save Session`. 
This will package your data and send to the backend server to be saved. The backend will generate a unique id for the session
and give you a link that you can share with others or save for later use.

If you are logged in, the session will be saved to your account and you can access it later by clicking `Session` -> `Account`.
